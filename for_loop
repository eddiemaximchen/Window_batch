# variable expression ==> command line: %variable ==>script: %%variable
# format for %%i in (scoop) do () ==> like python for i in range()
for %%i in (*) do (
    echo %%i <----here is case sensitive 
    timeout 1
)

for %%i in (*.mp4 *.avi *.mpg) DO @echo %%i ==> if true in () assign value to i and echo(print out) batch file only because of %%
for /D %i in (%userprofile%\*) DO @echo %i ==> in command line print out all dir under user home dir
for /R c:\temp\ %%G in (*.bak) do del "%%G" ==> delete all *.bak in temp and all subdir
FOR /F "tokens=1,2 delims==" %%i IN (test.ini) DO set %%i=%%j
# For /F IN (test.ini) => read file test.ini line by line
#tokens=1,2 means two variabel
#set 1=i 2=j
# delims==' one line one variable

==== for %%i in (*) DO echo %%i & timeout 1
# In batch file if it does not explicitly mention, variable will use the first value, and ignore the rest.
# set var=Peter & set var=John & echo %var%  var=Peter
# if you want the var= John, you need to do variable delay
# add this expression SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION before you assign value to a variable 
# In this time, variable will only get the value when you request, which is the lastest one.
