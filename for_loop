# In batch file if it does not explicitly mention, variable will use the first value, and ignore the rest.
# set var=Peter & set var=John & echo %var%  var=Peter
# if you want the var= John, you need to do variable delay
# add this expression SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION before you assign value to a variable 
# In this time, variable will only get the value when you request, which is the lastest one.
